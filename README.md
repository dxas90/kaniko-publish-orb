# Kaniko Publish Orb

Build and publish container images to container registries *without* docker

Under the hood this uses Google's [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) project, but aims to provide the same interface as the [circleci/docker-publish](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/docker-publish) orb
